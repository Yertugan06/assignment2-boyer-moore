# Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm

## 📌 Overview

This project implements the **Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm** in Java. The algorithm efficiently detects whether an element appears more than ⌊n/2⌋ times in an array, using **O(n) time and O(1) space**.

The implementation follows **clean code principles**, includes **input validation**, **comprehensive unit testing**, **performance tracking**, and a **command-line interface (CLI)** for benchmarking across different input sizes and distributions.

---

## 🧮 Algorithm Explanation

The Boyer-Moore Majority Vote algorithm works in two phases:

1. **Candidate Selection (Voting Phase)**

    * Iterate through the array while maintaining a `candidate` and a `count`.
    * If `count == 0`, assign the current element as the new candidate.
    * If the current element equals the candidate, increment `count`; otherwise, decrement `count`.

2. **Validation Phase**

    * After the first pass, the candidate may or may not be the true majority.
    * A second pass verifies if the candidate appears more than ⌊n/2⌋ times.

**Example:**
Input: `[3, 3, 4, 2, 3, 3, 5, 3]`

* Voting Phase → Candidate = `3`
* Validation Phase → Count of `3` = 5 > n/2 (4)
* Output → `3`

**Complexity:**

* **Time:** `O(n)`
* **Space:** `O(1)`

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites

* Java 11+
* Maven 3.6+

### Build Project

```bash
mvn clean package
```

### Run Tests

```bash
mvn test
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Running the CLI Benchmark

```bash
java -cp target/classes cli.BenchmarkRunner <size> <distribution>
```

**Arguments:**

1. `size` – Number of elements in the array (e.g., `10000`)
2. `distribution` – Input distribution type:

    * `random` → Random integers
    * `sorted` → Increasing order
    * `reverse` → Decreasing order
    * `majority` → Contains a guaranteed majority element
    * `none` → Balanced so no majority exists

**Example:**

```bash
java -cp target/classes cli.BenchmarkRunner 10000 majority
```

**Output Example:**

```
Input size: 10000
Distribution: majority
Majority element: 42
Comparisons: 15678
Array accesses: 20000
Execution time (ms): 3.25
```

---

## ✅ Testing

The project includes **unit tests** using **JUnit 5**.

### Covered Edge Cases

* Empty array (throws exception)
* Single element (always majority)
* Array with clear majority
* Array with no majority
* All elements identical
* Sorted input
* Reverse-sorted input

### Run Tests

```bash
mvn test
```

---

## 📊 Performance & Metrics

The implementation tracks the following:

* **Comparisons** → Number of equality checks performed
* **Array Accesses** → Number of element reads
* **Execution Time** → Measured in nanoseconds

### Input Distributions Tested

* **Random** → Uniformly distributed values
* **Sorted** → Best-case for cache locality
* **Reverse-sorted** → Similar behavior to sorted
* **Majority** → Ensures an element > n/2 exists
* **None** → Ensures no element exceeds n/2

### Scalability Tests

Arrays ranging from `10²` to `10⁵` elements.

### Memory Usage

* Space complexity remains constant: `O(1)`
* No extra memory allocations apart from the tracker
